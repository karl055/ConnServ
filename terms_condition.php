                        <p>ConnServ's service aims to boost small and medium-sized businesses. The 
                        developers will give complete assistance in establishing their firm and gaining 
                        devoted clients. They will also cater to large businesses to assist our users in finding 
                        the greatest match for their needs. The website inspired by Connection in Service 
                        (ConnServ) will feature a nice user interface with simple navigation for the elderly 
                        and non-technical users. Building a customer account necessitates minimal 
                        information, but creating a service account necessitates additional information, 
                        legal documentation, and a commitment. The locations of the chosen services will 
                        be presented. The available services will be classified from beginning and small 
                        services to medium services; a guidance for identifying small to medium services 
                        will be included in the service account setup process.
